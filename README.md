# Wordle Aidle
Wordle has been the hype of the internet for January and February 2022, and I have jumped into the bandwagon of playing the game. However, sometimes guessing a word each day may take too much time (apparently 5 minutes each day is a lot for a game.. üòê) and I would like to have something that automatically helps me solve today's Wordle, so that I won't lose my streak.

Therefore like a lot of programmers who jumped into the bandwagon, I've made a tool to solve Wordle, hopefully better than I can üòÖ.

## The Game of Wordle
Chances are if you came here, you probably don't need any introduction to the game. However, here's a brief explaination of how the game works.

The game starts with a 6 by 5 grid, each would be filled with a letter. Your goal is to guess a mystery 5-letter-word which is determined daily. You are to make a guess without any hints from the start. For each entry you've entered, you will receive hints on whether a letter exists in the mystery word, as well as whether if it is in the right position.

The hints are colour coded as follows:
 - Green - Letter is in the word and in the correct position
 - Yellow - Letter is in the word but in the wrong position
 - Grey - Letter is not in the word

You are to guess the mystery word making use of the hints in 6 tries. You will pass if you've guessed the word in under 6 tries, or if failed the mystery word will be revealed.

## Application
The solver application is named Wordle Aidle ‚Äî inspired from Wordle, which was inspired creatively by the creator's name, Josh Wardle. It is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application that involves the Terminal. However, unlike many CLI applications, this application does not take in any arguments (not yet), but it prints out menus with several options for user to input, and navigetes to the feature the user has chosen.

## Building the Solver Application
As of now the solver does not include any binary files (thou for Windows there will be soon.. but not sure how soon), so if you want to use it you will have to download the source code and build it yourself.

It is not as hard as it sounds though..

In order to build this application you will need to download the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) and make, then install it into your system. The installation of GCC and make differs depending on the Operating System (OS) you are running.

### Windows
For Windows it is recommended to use [Minimalist GNU for Windows (MinGW)](https://www.mingw-w64.org/). You can download the command line tools required [here](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/#mingw-builds) (Click on the Sourceforge link). Once installed you should be able to use commands like gcc and make (sometimes it could be 'mingw32-make' or 'mingw64-make'). Open Command Prompt (or PowerShell) and test the two commands out.
#### GCC expected output
```
gcc: fatal error: no input files
compilation terminated.
```
#### Make expected output
```
mingw32-make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found.  Stop.
```
To build, you will need to navigate to the root directory of the clone by typing `cd ` and dragging the folder into the prompt window. Then type make for_windows and it will automatically build the application. After it's done, the executable `waidle.exe` will be generated.
### macOS
To install GCC and make for macOS you will need to install Xcode Command Line Tools. You can install it using the terminal command `xcode-select --install` and follow the prompt instructions. Alternatively you can also use homebrew to install Xcode Command Line Tools. You can also do [a quick google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=xcode+command+line+tools) on how to install.

After installation you should see output similar to the ones shown in the Windows section above when you type `gcc` and `make`.

To build, navigate to the base directory using Terminal and simply type `make for_mac`. After building, you can type ./waidle to run.
### Linux
For linux users, use your distro's package manager to install GCC and make. Example `sudo apt install gcc` for debian/ubuntu-based systems, or `sudo pacman -S gcc` for arch-based systems.

To build, navigate to the base directory using Terminal/Console and simply type `make for_linux`. After building, you can type ./waidle to run.

### Cleanup
The folder `__build_tmp__` will be created during the building process. You can manually delete the folder after building or run `make clean_windows` or `make clean_linux` to remove the folder.

**NOTE:** Running the above command will delete **everything** inside the `__build_tmp__` folder, including any new stuff you've put inside or stuff you happen to have in the folder before building.

## Features
This app is hardcoded with all 12972 valid words that Wordle accepts as answers, including the 2309 Wordle answers. 

*Note that there are other programmers stating that there are 2315 words. That is because they were fetching from an old word list from Wordle before NYT deleted words that are considered sensitive or offensive. The 25 deleted words are in a comment in the hardcoded dictionary source file.*

In addition, there are 5812 additional hardcoded words that are not considered valid for Wordle, collated from different sources. The sources are in the comments of the hardcoded dictionary source file.

*This project is having its first days on GitHub. It need time to adopt to it's new envrionment.
Stay tuned as this page is in the progress of making. The rest is to be written...*
