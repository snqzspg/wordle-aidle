v0.4.0
 - Added two new random pick algorithms; these just pick a random five-letter-word for each suggestion with no regards to the given clues.
 - Added an experimental "Anti-absurdle" algorithm, which suggests words based on the lowest number of possible answers in the pattern that has the most matching words for each possible suggestion.
 - Suggesting algorithms are now grouped into categories for a cleaner option selection experience.
 - Make logs less annoying.
 - Used a new counter system.
 - Removed silly Heap Sort implementation.
 - Made several debugging features available without modifying the source code.
 - Included a debugging feature for Informational theory solvers which allows it to log the scores for all possible suggestions into 'debug.txt'.
 - Spoiler mode is accessible via two secret codes (only require one to activate). One is stored as obfuscated text and the other is stored as a hash.
 - Application now accepts an argument, '--no_clear_console', which will prevent the application from clearing your terminal history.
 - Before the application clears your terminal history, it will now provide an option for it to not clear your history.

v0.3.4
 - Updated the word list in this app as Wordle had its word list changed.
 - This is to avoid a word being seen as a commentary of the current debate of abortion rights.

v0.3.3
 - Selemat Hari Raya Aidilfitri (Eid al-Fitr) for Muslim friends.
 - Added two words into valid guesses word list: 'koran' and 'quran'

v0.3.2
 - Added detection of console sizes (Works on UNIX and Windows)
 - Some indented texts now warp with indents - although they will not adjust while you resize.
 - Further code restructuring works.
 - Added a disclaimer in the face of New York Times shutting down Wordle Archive.
 - Changed "Statistical" to "Information Theory".
 - Modified hard mode Information Theory Algorithm to make better guesses. The best performance achieved so far is 99.96% success (2308 or 2309 Wordle words passed), using the word "champ".
 - Fixed a memory leak.

v0.3.1.1
 - Updated the word list in this app as Wordle had its word list changed.

v0.3.1
 - Added optimised Information Entropy to enable faster testing process for Information Entropy.
 - Added Hybrid Algorithms, combination of Column Frequency and Information Entropy algorithms.
 - This hybrid algorithm was inspired from https://betterprogramming.pub/building-a-wordle-bot-in-under-100-lines-of-python-9b980539defb
 - Several code restructuring for cleaner code in future versions.

v0.3.0
 - Initial (relative) stable release.
 - Solver includes Column Frequency, Information Entropy and Random guess algorithms.
 - Solver also includes an imitated Wordle game, as well as a algorithm tester.
 - Includes 12947 words from the official Wordle game. 2309 of them are answers. Words are currently hard coded in the program
 - Also includes 5837 extra words not in Wordle's word list.
